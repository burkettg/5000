		"So if any roll has a 1 or a 5, you are still in your 'heater'.\n" +
		"That means you are still able to roll.\n" +
		"You can also get three of a kind.  You just take the number on the die " +
		"times 100.  Three 'fours' equals 400.  Three 'fives' equals 500.  You get the point.\n\n" +
		"There are also two special scores..  Three 'ones' equals 1000.\n" +
		"If you get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 all in the same roll, you get 1000.\n\n" +
		"If you 'keep' all your die, the game will reset the die and " +
		"let you keep rolling for more points.  When you have run out of luck\n" +
		"(feel like you won't get a valid roll next time), you can take your score.\n\n" +
		"Just remember, if you don't get a valid score " +
		"on any given roll- you BUNK.  That means you lose all your current heater points and give " +
		"up your turn.  Good Luck!!"
